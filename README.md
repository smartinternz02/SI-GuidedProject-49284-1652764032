# What is Diabetic Retinopathy?
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, which causes lesions on the retina that effect vision. 
If it is not detected early, it can lead to blindness.
Unfortunately, DR is not a reversible process, and treatment only sustains vision. 
Early detection and treatment of DR can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. 
The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time, effort and cost-consuming and prone to misdiagnosis unlike computer-aided diagnosis systems.

# Our Project
In this project, we will be building a Transfer learning model that can detect and classify types of Diabetic Retinopathy. 
A web application is integrated with the model, from where the user can upload a Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) image like Mild DR, Severe DR, etc., and see the analyzed results on UserInterface.
